# Name 

Dancer2-Sample  Source code to accompany a presentation on Dancer2 for Minneapolis Perl Mongers.

# Presentation

The presentation can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvRQz3RP0Z4CuhYxbivzpLIxPm_Z).  
Notes in the presentation should reference specific tags within the code, so it should be 
fairly easy to check out each specific example.
